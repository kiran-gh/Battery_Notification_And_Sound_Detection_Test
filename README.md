<h1>Battery Notification & Sound Detection Test</h1>

<p>In a recent real-time testing scenario for a web-based application, I was tasked with verifying that the application produces a beep sound and changes the battery indicator color to red when the battery level drops below 20%. The challenge was to ensure that the application responds correctly when the battery percentage falls below this threshold. Specifically, the system should visually display the battery in red and generate an audible alert (beep sound) to notify users of the low battery level. These functionalities are essential in providing clear, user-friendly feedback to prevent disruptions due to low battery. By testing this, I confirmed that the system's visual and auditory cues work as expected, enhancing the user experience for low-battery notifications.</p>
